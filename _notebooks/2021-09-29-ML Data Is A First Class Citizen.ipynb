    "In My last post in context with Machine Learning in Production I discussed [Why Data Defination Is Hard](https://aamirai.github.io/square/2021/07/02/Why-Data-Definition-is-So-much-important.html) in this post I am going to discuss why you should treat your data as First class citizen. Data is the hardest part of ML and important piece to get it right. Data in academic or research environment is quite different from the Production environment. Before moving any further Production ML in short is a combination of ML development and modern software development practices. Well in academia it's fairly simple you get standard dataset fairly cleaned and labelled, you optimize it and evaluate the result. Once you are happy with the result you are typically done. In production environment it ML code is just a drop in the ocean.\n",

    "The reason why production ML (from now onwards I will use MLOps) is most vulnerable and the reason itâ€™s most important aspect is that the data is dynamic and usually shifting. \n",
    "It would be fair to say that you can look at Production Machine Learning as both machine learning itself and the knowledge and skillset required and modern software development. It really requires expertise in both areas to be successful, because you're not just producing a single result; you're developing a product or service that is often a mission critical part of your offering. We deploy it, maintain it, and improve it so that we can make them available to our users and user businesses.\n"

    "Adopting a model is much more important task than understand the ML algorithm. For any given problem, understanding the problem statement is the first step in finding the solution. Similarly, scoping in MLOps which focuses on defining the project needs and goals and the resources required to achieve them. Next, you start working on your data, which defining the features that you're going to use well as organizing and labelling your data. That may sometimes include measuring human level performance to set a baseline for comparison. Then you design and train a model. In this phase, error analysis will help you refine your model to suit your project's needs. After training your model, you deploy it so that it can be used to serve prediction requests. You have available options like, mobile devices, on a Cloud, or in IoT devices, or even in a web browser. \n",
    "One thing every Data scientist or ML engineer must know the fact that **Your data will change Over time** well there are different types of it that I will discuss later. So keep in mind that real-world data continuously changes, which can result in a degradation of your model performance. You need to continuously monitor the performance of your model, and if you measure a drop in performance, you need to go back to model retraining and tuning, or revise your data. During deployment, new data may affect your project design either positively or negatively and risk coping might be necessary. Ultimately, all these steps create your production ML system, which needs to run automatically such that you're continuously monitoring your model performance, ingesting new data, and retraining as needed, and then redeploying to maintain or improve your performance. Keeping these things in mind will help you automate the whole process, it seems daunting but don't worry I will discuss the methods and methodologies for doing this.\n",

    "Thanks to many open source community out there to implement ML pipelines one such open source library we have is [Tensorflow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx). As soon you start using TFx for production you will realise how important these libraries are. Now let us discuss how pipelines orchestration sequence and schedule ML tasks to implement the entire ML training process. But you must ask question **What is ML Pipeline?**, it's easy just remember the above diagram, the ML in production is an iterative process, keeping your code static more on data driven technique you have to work back and forth every time when there is some new finding or shift in the data. Sometimes you have to redo the scoping (which is defining the needs, goals and resources.) But you can't stop every time when there is new data. The pipeline above is all about automating, monitoring, and maintaining this ML workflow from data to a trained model. ML Pipelines form a key component of MLOps architectures.\n",

TFX help you to implement that, TFX in production components are built on top of open-source libraries, such as Tensorflow Data Validation.\n"

    "This is what we refer to as the Hello World of TFX. We start on the left with our data and we're going to ingest our data with a TFX component called **ExampleGen**. All the boxes in orange that you see here are TFX components. In fact, these are components that come with TFX when you just do a PIP install. Next, we generate statistics for our data. We want to know the ranges of our features, if they're numerical features, if they're categorical features, we want to know what are the valid categories and so forth. What are the types of our features? **Example Validator** is used to look for problems in our data. **SchemaGen** is used to generate a schema for our data across our feature vector. **Transform** will do feature engineering. **Tuner and Trainer** are used to train a model and to tune the hyper-parameters for that model. **Evaluator** is used to do deep analysis of the performance of our model. We'll talk about what we mean by deep analysis a little bit later. **Infra Validator** is used to make sure that we can actually run predictions using our model on the infrastructure that we have. For example, do we have enough memory? If all of that passes and the model actually performs better than what we might already have in production. Then Pusher pushes the model to Production. What does that mean? Well, we might be pushing to a repository like Tensorflow HUB and then using our model later for maybe transfer learning or generating Embeddings. We could be pushing to TensorFlow JS If we're going to be using our model in a web browser or a Node.js application. We could push to TensorFlow Lite and use our model in a mobile application or on an IOT device. Or we could push to TensorFlow Serving and UserModel on a server or maybe a serving cluster. The key points here, first of all, Production ML Pipelines are more than just ML code. They're ML development and software development and a formalized process for running that sequence of tasks end to end, in a maintainable and scalable way."
